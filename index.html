<p><b>History-</b> Durham House of Pets was founded in 1909 by Samuel Wilkins. Samuel Wilkins grew up on a farm in Burlington, Vermont. He moved to Durham, New Hampshire permanently after studying agriculture at the University of New Hampshire. When Wilkins opened the store he sold food for livestock. Subsequently, the store was formerly known as Durham House of Farming. The store primarily serviced the university; although it did serve some local farms. In 1940, Samuelâ€™s descendant Maryann Mahoney transformed Durham House of Farming into a pet store; and changed the name to Durham House of Pets. The store carried dogs, cats, rabbits, fish, reptiles, pet food and livestock food. The store also now serviced the greater Durham area; alongside the University.
